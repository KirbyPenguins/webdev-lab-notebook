### HTML

Enter your reflections on this section here.
Html is super simple, it is intuitive and a great
way to start this class. I think making sure that you
know the inputs that you are doing and how to use them. 
I want to learn more about the submit buttons and reset 
buttons.


For week 2 I found that it was super helpful and easy to understand.
That is mostly because it was HW1 and since I had already have done it.
It was really nice practice

For Week 3 the CSS excersises were a lot harder! I them without any help and then tried to work on them without the video. However I did have to use the video as a guide. I really appreciate the videos especially when it comes to the last one as we did not really learn as much when it came to when we are shrinking the size of a css especially when it comes to using a mobile size. I feel that I did the last section right however I have a little descrepency than the week 6 videos. 


For Week 4 flex blox I had a really hard time with the last one. I had to switch the height to 400px instead of 300px this is because for some weird reason it wouldnt work properly with 300. Other than that flex boxes are great and I will implement them in my project.
